# TODO

- [ ] Ad handling: playback-aware audio ad skip and promoted-track filtering; wire settings toggles.
- [ ] Scrobbling engine: track detection, threshold logic, now playing + scrobble; respect toggles.
- [ ] Notifications: native toast on successful scrobble; toggle-controlled.
- [ ] Settings persistence: load/save all toggles and slider; reflect on launch.
- [ ] Dark mode: injected CSS for SoundCloud + chrome; toggle (optionally system-aware).
- [ ] Tray/menu controls: minimize to tray, tray icon menu (open, play/pause, next/prev, quit).
- [ ] Media keys: play/pause/next/prev forwarding (MediaSession primary, DOM fallback).
- [ ] Overlay polish: ensure ribbon/modal don’t interfere with the site; keep version display correct in release.
